<h1>Auditions</h1>
<h2>When will auditions be held and where?</h2>
<p>
  Auditions will be held Saturday, December 13 at Santa Clara High
  School Theatre from 10 am to 2 pm.  We prefer that all people
  wanting to be a part of Music Rivals audition in public. However.
  If you are unable to attend due to prior commitments you can
  audition one other way.

  #1.  Start a <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic account</a>,
  add me as a friend (noelani) and make your audition video by
  December 13.
</p>
<p>
  If you are not auditioning in person, I MUST have an legitimate
  excuse (in writing, email is fine)for your absence.</p>
<p>
  **Please note if you do not have the ability to make video to be

<h1>Dear Valued Business Community Members:</h1>

<p>
  For the past 15 years, the Santa Clara Schools Foundation has been a
key contributor to classrooms in the Santa Clara Unified School
District.  We have provided over $600,000 in classroom grants to
teachers for supplies, field trips and the like.
</p>

<p>
  We are entering a new phase in our foundation and would like to
  contribute more to the school district on a yearly basis, while
  getting our community and the children in the district more involved
  in what the foundation is doing year to year.
</p>
<p>
  New this year is Music Rivals. Music Rivals is SCSUD’s very own
  Battle of the Bands/American Idol.  This will be a fun-filled night
  where the SCUSD’s very best musical talent will be showcased while
  competing for top prizes in three categories (Vocals, Instrumental
  and Band).  This show is not only a way to focus on our district’s
  talent, but we will also be raising money to put back into our
  school district.  We wanted to build a sense of community within our
  organization by doing something where everyone can get involved.
</p>

<p>
  We are asking our Business Community Members to get involved in a
  few ways.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Donating Foods and Beverages for our performers on dress rehearsal
    and the night of the show
  </li>
  <li>Donating food items to be sold during intermission</li>
</ol>

<p>
	If you have any questions about Music Rivals and how you can be
	involved, feel free to contact me personally
	at <a href="mailto:noelani@musicrivals.org">noelani@musicrivals.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We appreciate your helping enhancing our ability to support the
classrooms and the school district as a whole through the Santa Clara
Schools Foundation.  We thank you for your support and generosity.
</p>
<p>
  Sincerely,
</p>

<p>
